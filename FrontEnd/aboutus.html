        Welcome!

    </h2>

    <p>

        We are a paper submission, review and distribution for all of the Journals hosted in our University.
        Here authors can submit their journals to be reviewed from reviewers within different academic journals,
        see the feedback from those reviews and eventually have their papers published. Both reviewers and editors
        from these journals have their own profile too!
